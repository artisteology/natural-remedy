As we all know the weather in Belgium is unpredictable throughout the year rainfall here. Most peculiarly on a little sunny day, it also rains. Foreigners express a bad climate in Belgium. As a result, people sicken generally. Bacterial infections and viral infections are typical here. All over the year cough, flu, and fever are very ordinary. In summer most kids get sick when they drink or eat anything chilled but Asians have a lot of home treatments.
